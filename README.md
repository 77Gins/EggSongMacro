This is a simple macro made in AutoIT to automate the inputs required for a certain annoying sequence in Animal Well.

Egg song is cancer. If you know you know.  

To use: 
-Animal flute must be equipped. 
-You must be in the right place (do not stand too close to edges of the map where you could accidentally be moved to another area). 
-Use item must be bound to the default x key on your keyboard. 

Option 1) Bind EggSongInstant.exe to a keyboard shortcut (like with AutoHotkey or other software of your choice). Once this.exe is run it will immediately start inputting directions and the x key, so use this option if you can bind a shortcut to run this macro in-game when you are already in the right place with flute equipped.  

Option 2) Run EggSong10SecondDelay.exe. You get 10 seconds to open your Animal Well game window before the macro starts. You can take out the flute with x if you want, but it's not necessary. 

If you don't trust .exe files, feel free to download AutoIT and any code editor and inspect the source code .au3. You can compile it on your own or keybind the macro from there. Do whatever you want.

Bugs: AutoIT scripts sometimes can cause your Control/Shift/Alt key(s) to get virtually stuck, even after the script finishes executing. It has something to do with the Send key function--I don't know, I'm not a programmer. Usually, Control-Alt-Delete fixes it. Try running task manager and deleting any leftover autoit.exe tasks as well.
